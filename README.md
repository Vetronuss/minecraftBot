# minecraftBot
its a bot that plays minecraft
---
it is almost guaranteed that this will not work for you, it reads minecraft memory and sends inputs through the keyboard (mainly using ahk) to send baritone[(mc pathfinder)](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone) commands
---
### Proccess:
- mines logs
- crafts crafting table
- uses it to craft wood tools
- gathers stone
- uses crafting table to get stone tools
- gathers iron
- crafts furnace and places it
- BOT BREAKS CAUSE IT DOESNT KNOW WHEN THE IRON IS DONE SMELTING
- with help it grabs the iron ingots
- crafts tools
- mines diamonds for a good amount
- crafts full diamond armor and tools
### notes
- will craft crafting tables when it cant find one
- You have to manually find the last message sent memory address (using cheat engine or smn) when you start the bot
- You have to specify the file path of the ahk rebind script
- - this script rebinds F buttons (F13 - F26) so that minecraft reconizes them (idk why it doesnt normally)
